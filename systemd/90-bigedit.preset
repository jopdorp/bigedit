# Enable bigedit-watcher service by default for all users
# This preset makes the FUSE auto-mount service start automatically
# when users log in, so edited files are visible to other programs.
#
# Users can still disable it with:
#   systemctl --user disable bigedit-watcher.service
enable bigedit-watcher.service
